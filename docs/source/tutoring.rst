Tutoring
========

I focus on the following:

* **Math**
 **Algebra 3-4, precalculus, and calculus.**

* **NGSS Physics**

I meet students at:

* **A convenient library.**
* **I will reserve a study room (if available) or find a quiet table before we meet.**
* **I am okay going to a student's home.**
* **Students need to be fully vaccinated and boosted against Covid-19.**
* **We will wear medical grade masks.**
* **Parents are always welcome. Parents need to follow the same Covid-19 protocols.**

If you or your student needs some help with any of these classes, send me an 
email `jgwilson1214@gmail.com <jgwilson1214@gmail.com>`_.
Share with me:

* **The name of the student, contact information, class name, school, teacher.**
* **Your preferred day and time.**

**Tutoring rate for classes other than AP, IB, College**

* 1 student = $35/hour

**Tutoring rate for AP, IB, College, and other Advanced Courses**

* 1 student = $45/hour
