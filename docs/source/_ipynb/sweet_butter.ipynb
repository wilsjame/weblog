    "> Farmer John (FJ) has cow pastures all connected by paths. His cows are content grazing spread about these pastures. FJ loves his cows and treats them sugar cubes! He places sugar cubes in one pasture, rings a bell, and cows moo-ve to the sugar cube pasture. Cows are keen on sugar and always take the shortest path. We will write a program to efficiently find which pasture FJ should put the sugar to minimize the total distance traveled by his cows.\n",

    "## Vocabulary\n",
    "The key concepts for this problem:\n",
    "- **Node**: pasture.\n",
    "- **Weighted Edge**: length of direct connection between two pastures. \n",
    "- **Undirected**: edges can can be traversed in both directions.\n",
    "- **Shortest Path**: minimal sum of edge weights to get from pasture A to pasture B. (Other problems may want this as number of edges or sequence of nodes taken.)\n",
    "- **Adjacency List**: a data structure to represent a [graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_%28discrete_mathematics%29). Each node *a* in the graph is assigned an [adjacency list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjacency_list) that consists of nodes to where there is an edge from *a*.\n",
    "- **Dijkstra's Algorithm**: an algorithm which finds the shortest paths from a starting node to all other nodes. \n",
    "\n",
    "Related concepts are:\n",
    "- **Adjacency Matrix**: a data structure to represent a graph.\n",
