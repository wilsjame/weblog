About me
========

I graduated with a BS in Mechanical Engineering from Oregon State University in 2016.
From 2016 to 2018 I worked at `OEB Lab <https://health.oregonstate.edu/labs/oeb>`_ 
as a research assistant. I completed a postbacc in Computer Science in 2018 and
continued work at OEB Lab on augmented reality applications for Microsoft's
HoloLens and vibrational analysis tools. From 2019 to 2020 I worked at OptiTrack on 
their motion capture products. As of May 2022 I am working at Searchspring in Portland.

I enjoy programming, math, reading, swimming, barbecue, and outdoor activities.
